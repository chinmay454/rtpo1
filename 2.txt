One story tells of how Sambhaji once impressed visiting Persian scholars with his knowledge. During a court assembly, Persian envoys came to test the young prince's understanding of their language and poetry. To their surprise, Sambhaji not only understood their advanced literary expressions but also responded with original verses in Persian.

This event earned him the title of "Bahu Bhasha Vidwan" (one who knows many languages) and proved that he was not only a warrior but also a scholar, a rare combination in those times.
